      "Question ::::::::::: Hat matching may be considered \"broken\" because it wont update ^0.1.2 to 0.2.0. When the software is emerging use 0.x.y versions and hat matching will only match the last varying digit (y). This is done on purpose. The reason is that while the software is evolving the API changes rapidly: one day you have these methods and the other day you have those methods and the old ones are gone. If you don't want to break the code for people who already are using your library you go and increment the major version: e.g. 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0 -> 3.0.0. So, by the time your software is finally 100% done and full-featured it will be like version 11.0.0 and that doesn't look very meaningful, and actually looks confusing. If you were, on the other hand, using 0.1.x -> 0.2.x -> 0.3.x versions then by the time the software is finally 100% done and full-featured it is released as version 1.0.0 and it means \"This release is a long-term service one, you can proceed and use this version of the library in your production code, and the author won't change everything tomorrow, or next month, and he won't abandon the package\".\n",
      "The rule is: use 0.x.y versioning when your software hasn't yet matured and release it with incrementing the middle digit when your public API changes (therefore people having ^0.1.0 won't get 0.2.0 update and it won't break their code). Then, when the software matures, release it under 1.0.0 and increment the leftmost digit each time your public API changes (therefore people having ^1.0.0 won't get 2.0.0 update and it won't break their code).\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: Stdio Library\n",
      "The easiest way to parse command-line arguments in NodeJS is using the stdio module. Inspired by UNIX getopt utility, it is as trivial as follows:\n",
      "var stdio = require('stdio');\n",
      "var ops = stdio.getopt({\n",
      "    'check': {key: 'c', args: 2, description: 'What this option means'},\n",
      "    'map': {key: 'm', description: 'Another description'},\n",
      "    'kaka': {args: 1, mandatory: true},\n",
      "    'ooo': {key: 'o'}\n",
      "});\n",
      "If you run the previous code with this command:\n",
      "node <your_script.js> -c 23 45 --map -k 23 file1 file2\n",
      "Then ops object will be as follows:\n",
      "{ check: [ '23', '45' ],\n",
      "  args: [ 'file1', 'file2' ],\n",
      "  map: true,\n",
      "  kaka: '23' }\n",
      "So you can use it as you want. For instance:\n",
      "if (ops.kaka && ops.check) {\n",
      "    console.log(ops.kaka + ops.check[0]);\n",
      "}\n",
      "Grouped options are also supported, so you can write -om instead of -o -m.\n",
      "Furthermore, stdio can generate a help/usage output automatically. If you call ops.printHelp() you'll get the following:\n",
      "USAGE: node something.js [--check <ARG1> <ARG2>] [--kaka] [--ooo] [--map]\n",
      "  -c, --check <ARG1> <ARG2>   What this option means (mandatory)\n",

      "  --map                       Another description\n",
      "  -o, --ooo\n",
      "The previous message is shown also if a mandatory option is not given (preceded by the error message) or if it is mispecified (for instance, if you specify a single arg for an option and it needs 2).\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: You did a great job of summarizing what's awesome about Node.js. My feeling is that Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. Using a technique known as \"long-polling\", you can write an application that sends updates to the user in real time. Doing long polling on many of the web's giants, like Ruby on Rails or Django, would create immense load on the server, because each active client eats up one server process. This situation amounts to a tarpit attack. When you use something like Node.js, the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection.\n",
      "This means you can create a browser-based chat application in Node.js that takes almost no system resources to serve a great many clients. Any time you want to do this sort of long-polling, Node.js is a great option.\n",
      "It's worth mentioning that Ruby and Python both have tools to do this sort of thing (eventmachine and twisted, respectively), but that Node.js does it exceptionally well, and from the ground up. JavaScript is exceptionally well situated to a callback-based concurrency model, and it excels here. Also, being able to serialize and deserialize with JSON native to both the client and the server is pretty nifty.\n",
      "I look forward to reading other answers here, this is a fantastic question.\n",
      "It's worth pointing out that Node.js is also great for situations in which you'll be reusing a lot of code across the client/server gap. The Meteor framework makes this really easy, and a lot of folks are suggesting this might be the future of web development. I can say from experience that it's a whole lot of fun to write code in Meteor, and a big part of this is spending less time thinking about how you're going to restructure your data, so the code that runs in the browser can easily manipulate it and pass it back.\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: I believe Node.js is best suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot? or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh.\n",
      "I should also mention that Socket.IO in combination with Node.js will reduce your real-time latency even further than what is possible with long polling. Socket.IO will fall back to long polling as a worst case scenario, and instead use web sockets or even Flash if they are available.\n",
      "But I should also mention that just about any situation where the code might block due to threads can be better addressed with Node.js. Or any situation where you need the application to be event-driven.\n",
      "Also, Ryan Dahl said in a talk that I once attended that the Node.js benchmarks closely rival Nginx for regular old HTTP requests. So if we build with Node.js, we can serve our normal resources quite effectively, and when we need the event-driven stuff, it's ready to handle it.\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: Reasons to use NodeJS:\n",
      "It runs Javascript, so you can use the same language on server and client, and even share some code between them (e.g. for form validation, or to render views at either end.)\n",
      "The single-threaded event-driven system is fast even when handling lots of requests at once, and also simple, compared to traditional multi-threaded Java or ROR frameworks.\n",
      "The ever-growing pool of packages accessible through NPM, including client and server-side libraries/modules, as well as command-line tools for web development. Most of these are conveniently hosted on github, where sometimes you can report an issue and find it fixed within hours! It's nice to have everything under one roof, with standardized issue reporting and easy forking.\n",
      "It has become the defacto standard environment in which to run Javascript-related tools and other web-related tools, including task runners, minifiers, beautifiers, linters, preprocessors, bundlers and analytics processors.\n",
      "It seems quite suitable for prototyping, agile development and rapid product iteration.\n",
      "Reasons not to use NodeJS:\n",
      "It runs Javascript, which has no compile-time type checking. For large, complex safety-critical systems, or projects including collaboration between different organizations, a language which encourages contractual interfaces and provides static type checking may save you some debugging time (and explosions) in the long run. (Although the JVM is stuck with null, so please use Haskell for your nuclear reactors.)\n",
      "Added to that, many of the packages in NPM are a little raw, and still under rapid development. Some libraries for older frameworks have undergone a decade of testing and bugfixing, and are very stable by now. Npmjs.org has no mechanism to rate packages, which has lead to a proliferation of packages doing more or less the same thing, out of which a large percentage are no longer maintained.\n",
      "Nested callback hell. (Of course there are 20 different solutions to this...)\n",
      "The ever-growing pool of packages can make one NodeJS project appear radically different from the next. There is a large diversity in implementations due to the huge number of options available (e.g. Express/Sails.js/Meteor/Derby). This can sometimes make it harder for a new developer to jump in on a Node project. Contrast that with a Rails developer joining an existing project: he should be able to get familiar with the app pretty quickly, because all Rails apps are encouraged to use a similar structure.\n",
      "Dealing with files can be a bit of a pain. Things that are trivial in other languages, like reading a line from a text file, are weird enough to do with Node.js that there's a StackOverflow question on that with 80+ upvotes. There's no simple way to read one record at a time from a CSV file. Etc.\n",
      "I love NodeJS, it is fast and wild and fun, but I am concerned it has little interest in provable-correctness. Let's hope we can eventually merge the best of both worlds. I am eager to see what will replace Node in the future... :)\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: Node best for concurrent request handling -\n",
      "So, Let’s start with a story. From last 2 years I am working on JavaScript and developing web front end and I am enjoying it. Back end guys provide’s us some API’s written in Java,python (we don’t care) and we simply write a AJAX call, get our data and guess what ! we are done. But in real it is not that easy, If data we are getting is not correct or there is some server error then we stuck and we have to contact our back end guys over the mail or chat(sometimes on whatsApp too :).) This is not cool. What if we wrote our API’s in JavaScript and call those API’s from our front end ? Yes that’s pretty cool because if we face any problem in API we can look into it. Guess what ! you can do this now , How ? – Node is there for you.\n",
      "Ok agreed that you can write your API in JavaScript but what if I am ok with above problem. Do you have any other reason to use node for rest API ?\n",
      "so here is the magic begins. Yes I do have other reasons to use node for our API’s.\n",
      "Let’s go back to our traditional rest API system which is based on either blocking operation or threading. Suppose two concurrent request occurs( r1 and r2) , each of them require database operation. So In traditional system what will happens :\n",
      "1. Waiting Way : Our server starts serving r1 request and waits for query response. after completion of r1 , server starts to serve r2 and does it in same way. So waiting is not a good idea because we don’t have that much time.\n",
      "2. Threading Way : Our server will creates two threads for both requests r1 and r2 and serve their purpose after querying database so cool its fast.But it is memory consuming because you can see we started two threads also problem increases when both request is querying same data then you have to deal with deadlock kind of issues . So its better than waiting way but still issues are there.\n",
      "Now here is , how node will do it:\n",
      "3. Nodeway : When same concurrent request comes in node then it will register an event with its callback and move ahead it will not wait for query response for a particular request.So when r1 request comes then node’s event loop (yes there is an event loop in node which serves this purpose.) register an event with its callback function and move ahead for serving r2 request and similarly register its event with its callback. Whenever any query finishes it triggers its corresponding event and execute its callback to completion without being interrupted.\n",
      "So no waiting, no threading , no memory consumption – yes this is nodeway for serving rest API.\n",

      "Yesterday my title with Packt Publications, Reactive Programming with JavaScript. It isn't really a Node.js-centric title; early chapters are intended to cover theory, and later code-heavy chapters cover practice. Because I didn't really think it would be appropriate to fail to give readers a webserver, Node.js seemed by far the obvious choice. The case was closed before it was even opened.\n",
      "I could have given a very rosy view of my experience with Node.js. Instead I was honest about good points and bad points I encountered.\n",
      "Let me include a few quotes that are relevant here:\n",
      "Warning: Node.js and its ecosystem are hot--hot enough to burn you badly!\n",
      "When I was a teacher’s assistant in math, one of the non-obvious suggestions I was told was not to tell a student that something was “easy.” The reason was somewhat obvious in retrospect: if you tell people something is easy, someone who doesn’t see a solution may end up feeling (even more) stupid, because not only do they not get how to solve the problem, but the problem they are too stupid to understand is an easy one!\n",
      "There are gotchas that don’t just annoy people coming from Python / Django, which immediately reloads the source if you change anything. With Node.js, the default behavior is that if you make one change, the old version continues to be active until the end of time or until you manually stop and restart the server. This inappropriate behavior doesn’t just annoy Pythonistas; it also irritates native Node.js users who provide various workarounds. The StackOverflow question “Auto-reload of files in Node.js” has, at the time of this writing, over 200 upvotes and 19 answers; an edit directs the user to a nanny script, node-supervisor, with homepage at http://tinyurl.com/reactjs-node-supervisor. This problem affords new users with great opportunity to feel stupid because they thought they had fixed the problem, but the old, buggy behavior is completely unchanged. And it is easy to forget to bounce the server; I have done so multiple times. And the message I would like to give is, “No, you’re not stupid because this behavior of Node.js bit your back; it’s just that the designers of Node.js saw no reason to provide appropriate behavior here. Do try to cope with it, perhaps taking a little help from node-supervisor or another solution, but please don’t walk away feeling that you’re stupid. You’re not the one with the problem; the problem is in Node.js’s default behavior.”\n",
      "This section, after some debate, was left in, precisely because I don't want to give an impression of “It’s easy.” I cut my hands repeatedly while getting things to work, and I don’t want to smooth over difficulties and set you up to believe that getting Node.js and its ecosystem to function well is a straightforward matter and if it’s not straightforward for you too, you don’t know what you’re doing. If you don’t run into obnoxious difficulties using Node.js, that’s wonderful. If you do, I would hope that you don’t walk away feeling, “I’m stupid—there must be something wrong with me.” You’re not stupid if you experience nasty surprises dealing with Node.js. It’s not you! It’s Node.js and its ecosystem!\n",
      "The Appendix, which I did not really want after the rising crescendo in the last chapters and the conclusion, talks about what I was able to find in the ecosystem, and provided a workaround for moronic literalism:\n",
      "Another database that seemed like a perfect fit, and may yet be redeemable, is a server-side implementation of the HTML5 key-value store. This approach has the cardinal advantage of an API that most good front-end developers understand well enough. For that matter, it’s also an API that most not-so-good front-end developers understand well enough. But with the node-localstorage package, while dictionary-syntax access is not offered (you want to use localStorage.setItem(key, value) or localStorage.getItem(key), not localStorage[key]), the full localStorage semantics are implemented, including a default 5MB quota—WHY? Do server-side JavaScript developers need to be protected from themselves?\n",
      "For client-side database capabilities, a 5MB quota per website is really a generous and useful amount of breathing room to let developers work with it. You could set a much lower quota and still offer developers an immeasurable improvement over limping along with cookie management. A 5MB limit doesn’t lend itself very quickly to Big Data client-side processing, but there is a really quite generous allowance that resourceful developers can use to do a lot. But on the other hand, 5MB is not a particularly large portion of most disks purchased any time recently, meaning that if you and a website disagree about what is reasonable use of disk space, or some site is simply hoggish, it does not really cost you much and you are in no danger of a swamped hard drive unless your hard drive was already too full. Maybe we would be better off if the balance were a little less or a little more, but overall it’s a decent solution to address the intrinsic tension for a client-side context.\n",
      "However, it might gently be pointed out that when you are the one writing code for your server, you don’t need any additional protection from making your database more than a tolerable 5MB in size. Most developers will neither need nor want tools acting as a nanny and protecting them from storing more than 5MB of server-side data. And the 5MB quota that is a golden balancing act on the client-side is rather a bit silly on a Node.js server. (And, for a database for multiple users such as is covered in this Appendix, it might be pointed out, slightly painfully, that that’s not 5MB per user account unless you create a separate database on disk for each user account; that’s 5MB shared between all user accounts together. That could get painful if you go viral!) The documentation states that the quota is customizable, but an email a week ago to the developer asking how to change the quota is unanswered, as was the StackOverflow question asking the same. The only answer I have been able to find is in the Github CoffeeScript source, where it is listed as an optional second integer argument to a constructor. So that’s easy enough, and you could specify a quota equal to a disk or partition size. But besides porting a feature that does not make sense, the tool’s author has failed completely to follow a very standard convention of interpreting 0 as meaning “unlimited” for a variable or function where an integer is to specify a maximum limit for some resource use. The best thing to do with this misfeature is probably to specify that the quota is Infinity:\n",
      "if (typeof localStorage === 'undefined' || localStorage === null)\n",
      "  {      \n",
      "  var LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;\n",

      "Swapping two comments in order:\n",
      "People needlessly shot themselves in the foot constantly using JavaScript as a whole, and part of JavaScript being made respectable language was a Douglas Crockford saying in essence, “JavaScript as a language has some really good parts and some really bad parts. Here are the good parts. Just forget that anything else is there.” Perhaps the hot Node.js ecosystem will grow its own “Douglas Crockford,” who will say, “The Node.js ecosystem is a coding Wild West, but there are some real gems to be found. Here’s a roadmap. Here are the areas to avoid at almost any cost. Here are the areas with some of the richest paydirt to be found in ANY language or environment.”\n",
      "Perhaps someone else can take those words as a challenge, and follow Crockford’s lead and write up “the good parts” and / or “the better parts” for Node.js and its ecosystem. I’d buy a copy!\n",
      "And given the degree of enthusiasm and sheer work-hours on all projects, it may be warranted in a year, or two, or three, to sharply temper any remarks about an immature ecosystem made at the time of this writing. It really may make sense in five years to say, “The 2015 Node.js ecosystem had several minefields. The 2020 Node.js ecosystem has multiple paradises.”\n",

      "Question ::::::::::: peerDependencies didn't quite make sense for me until I read this snippet from a blog post on the topic Ciro mentioned above:\n",
      "What [plugins] need is a way of expressing these “dependencies” between plugins and their host package. Some way of saying, “I only work when plugged in to version 1.2.x of my host package, so if you install me, be sure that it’s alongside a compatible host.” We call this relationship a peer dependency.\n",
      "The plugin does expect a specific version of the host...\n",
      "peerDependencies are for plugins, libraries that require a \"host\" library to perform their function, but may have been written at a time before the latest version of the host was released.\n",
      "That is, if I write PluginX v1 for HostLibraryX v3 and walk away, there's no guarantee PluginX v1 will work when HostLibraryX v4 (or even HostLibraryX v3.0.1) is released.\n",
      "... but the plugin doesn't depend on the host...\n",
      "From the point of view of the plugin, it only adds functions to the host library. I don't really \"need\" the host to add a dependency to a plugin, and plugins often don't literally depend on their host. If you don't have the host, the plugin harmlessly does nothing.\n",
      "This means dependencies isn't really the right concept for plugins.\n",
      "Even worse, if my host was treated like a dependency, we'd end up in this situation that the same blog post mentions (edited a little to use this answer's made up host & plugin):\n",
      "But now, [if we treat the contemporary version of HostLibraryX as a dependency for PluginX,] running npm install results in the unexpected dependency graph of\n",
      "├── HostLibraryX@4.0.0\n",
      "└─┬ PluginX@1.0.0\n",
      "  └── HostLibraryX@3.0.0\n",
      "I’ll leave the subtle failures that come from the plugin using a different [HostLibraryX] API than the main application to your imagination.\n",
      "... and the host obviously doesn't depend on the plugin...\n",
      "... that's the whole point of plugins. Now if the host was nice enough to include dependency information for all of its plugins, that'd solve the problem, but that'd also introduce a huge new cultural problem: plugin management!\n",
      "The whole point of plugins is that they can pair up anonymously. In a perfect world, having the host manage 'em all would be neat & tidy, but we're not going to require libraries herd cats.\n",
      "If we're not hierarchically dependent, maybe we're intradependent peers...\n",
      "Instead, we have the concept of being peers. Neither host nor plugin sits in the other's dependency bucket. Both live at the same level of the dependency graph.\n",
      "... but this is not an automatable relationship.\n",
      "If I'm PluginX v1 and expect a peer of (that is, have a peerDependency of) HostLibraryX v3, I'll say so. If you've auto-upgraded to the latest HostLibraryX v4 (note that's version 4) AND have Plugin v1 installed, you need to know, right?\n",
      "npm can't manage this situation for me --\n",
      "\"Hey, I see you're using PluginX v1! I'm automatically downgrading HostLibraryX from v4 to v3, kk?\"\n",
      "... or...\n",
      "\"Hey I see you're using PluginX v1. That expects HostLibraryX v3, which you've left in the dust during your last update. To be safe, I'm automatically uninstalling Plugin v1!!1!\n",
      "How about no, npm?!\n",
      "So npm doesn't. It alerts you to the situation, and lets you figure out if HostLibraryX v4 is a suitable peer for Plugin v1.\n",
      "Coda\n",
      "Good peerDependency management in plugins will make this concept work more intuitively in practice. From the blog post, yet again...\n",
      "One piece of advice: peer dependency requirements, unlike those for regular dependencies, should be lenient. You should not lock your peer dependencies down to specific patch versions. It would be really annoying if one Chai plugin peer-depended on Chai 1.4.1, while another depended on Chai 1.5.0, simply because the authors were lazy and didn’t spend the time figuring out the actual minimum version of Chai they are compatible with.\n",

The process.exitCode property can be set to tell the process which exit code to use when the process exits gracefully.\n",
      "Let’s cover possible reasons why you might be willing to exit node.js process and why you should avoid process.exit():\n",
      "Case 1 - Execution complete (command line script)\n",
      "If script has reached its end and node interpreter doesn't exit, it indicates that some async operations are still pending. It’s wrong to force process termination with process.exit() at this point. It’s better to try to understand what is holding your script from exiting in expected way.

      "Case 2 - Termination because of external signal (SIGINT/SIGTERM/other)\n",
      "For example, if you’re willing to gracefully shut down an express app. Unlike command line script, express app keeps running infinitely, waiting for new requests. process.exit() will be a bad option here because it’s going to interrupt all requests which are in pipeline. And some of them might be non-idempotent (UPDATE, DELETE). Client will never know if those requests are completed or not on server side and it might be the reason of data inconsistency between client and server.

      "Case 3 - Internal error\n",
      "It's always better to throw an error, you’ll get a nicely formatted stack trace and error message. Upper levels of code can always decide if they can handle error (catch) or let it crash the process. On the other side, process.exit(1) will terminate process silently and there will be no chance to recover from this.

      "As of npm 5.0.0, installed modules are added as a dependency by default, so the --save option is no longer needed. The other save options still exist and are listed in the documentation for npm install.\n",
      "Original answer:\n",
      "Before version 5, NPM simply installed a package under node_modules by default. When you were trying to install dependencies for your app/module, you would need to first install them, and then add them (along with the appropriate version number) to the dependencies section of your package.json.\n",
      "The --save option instructed NPM to include the package inside of the dependencies section of your package.json automatically, thus saving you an additional step.\n",
      "In addition, there are the complementary options --save-dev and --save-optional which save the package under devDependencies and optionalDependencies, respectively. This is useful when installing development-only packages, like grunt or your testing library.\n",

      "Node comes with npm pre-installed, but the manager is updated more frequently than Node. Run npm -v to see which version you have, then npm install npm@latest -g to install the newest npm update. Run npm -v again if you want to make sure npm updated correctly.\n",
